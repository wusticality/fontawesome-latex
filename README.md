# fontawesome-latex

Latex bindings for `FontAwesome v5.5.0`.


Note that `FontAwesome` has been separated into three separate `otf` files now. Icons are split across three separate fonts: `solid`, `regular`, and `brand`. To access a specific icon in one of these fonts, use the prefix `\fas`, `\far`, and `\fab`, respectively. For example:

`\fasAllergies` `\farWindowRestore` `\fabNintendoSwitch`
